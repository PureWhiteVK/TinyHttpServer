`key.pem` and `cert.pem` is generated by mkcert, contains `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` certificate,
to install CA, make sure set the `CAROOT` for mkcert

in powershell

```powershell
cd data/CA
$env:CAROOT=$pwd
```

in bash
```bash
export CAROOT=$(pwd)
```

in mkcert, we can use the following command to check current `CAROOT`

```bash
mkcert -CAROOT
```

to install CA
```bash
mkcert -install
```

to uninstall CA
```bash
mkcert -uninstall
```

then generate certification (must done after install CA)

```bash
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1
```

and then rename the cert file to `cert.pem`, key file to `key.pem`
